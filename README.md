# Slot Game Project

This repository contains the initial files and plans for a slot game inspired by classic tumbling mechanics (similar to Gates of Olympus).  
The game will be developed using the Stake SDK, including both Math and Frontend frameworks.  
All outcomes will be pre-simulated and optimized for fair play and smooth user experience.

Developed by Omar Studio (independent developer).
